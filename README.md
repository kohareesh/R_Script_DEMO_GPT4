# R_Script_DEMO_GPT4
Script to Demo contextual Chat using Gpt4 model as a Context Aware Program

You will need api_key from open AI and also credits to support the queries 

Can easily upgrade this script to future models rolled out by chatgpt by changing end point and model. 
I have used https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions end point and you may customize ro your use case 

My Data Set for test/ demo purpses

For test purposes, I downloaded a large public data set from Spotify found here in file named :
data.csv https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-1921-2020-160k-tracks/data

Suggest adjusting following parameters to your use case:
